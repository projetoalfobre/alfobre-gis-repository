DIGITAL ATLAS OF DIOCESES AND ECCLESIASTICAL PROVINCES IN LATE MEDIEVAL EUROPE (1200-1500)
ReadMe File; Last updated: March 5, 2021

**Overview**
The eight maps in this collection depict the boundaries of dioceses and ecclesiastical provinces in Latin Christendom during the later Middle Ages (1200-1500). They exclude jurisdictions in the Latin East and in parts of eastern Europe whose boundaries are unknown or were never firmly established.
The maps were generated from 2016-2021 as part of the Corpus Synodalium project (Project Leader: Rowan Dorin); for more details, see http:www.corpus-synodalium.com. A list of contributors and funding sources can be found in the accompanying ‘Contributors and Acknowledgments’ document. 
The maps were created using the ArcGIS product suite, with boundary information being extracted from a wide variety of print and digital sources. A list of all of the underlying sources can be found in the accompanying ‘Map Sources’ document. Supplementary metadata for all of the mapping files can be found in the ‘Digital Atlas – Tabular Metadata’ file. 
Corrections to the metadata and mapping files are warmly welcomed; contact dorin@stanford.edu. 

**Map Descriptions**
1. Dioceses, Medieval Europe, 1200-1500: Polygons of the boundaries of ca. 750 dioceses across Latin Christendom as they appeared between 1200-1500. Rather than corresponding to any particular year, the map is an amalgam that displays all Latin dioceses that existed at some point during this period.
2. Dioceses, Medieval Europe, ca. 1250: Polygons of the boundaries of ca. 750 dioceses across Latin Christendom as they appeared during the thirteenth century. For those dioceses whose boundaries changed during this century, the map shows the longest-lasting boundaries within this period. (The same is true for all of the other century-limited diocesan maps in the collection.)
3. Dioceses, Medieval Europe, ca. 1350: Polygons of the boundaries of ca. 750 dioceses across Latin Christendom as they appeared during the fourteenth century.
4. Dioceses, Medieval Europe, ca. 1450: Polygons of the boundaries of ca. 750 dioceses across Latin Christendom as they appeared during the fifteenth century.
5. Ecclesiastical Provinces, Medieval Europe, 1200-1500: Polygons of the boundaries of the ecclesiastical provinces of Latin Christendom as they appeared between 1200-1500. Rather than corresponding to any particular year, this map is an amalgam that displays all provinces that existed at some point during this period.
6. Ecclesiastical Provinces, Medieval Europe, ca. 1250: Polygons of the boundaries of the ecclesiastical provinces of Latin Christendom as they appeared during the thirteenth century. For those provinces whose boundaries and/or suffragans changed during this century, the map shows the longest-lasting boundaries within the period. (The same is true for all of the other century-limited provincial maps in the collection.)
